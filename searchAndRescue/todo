* collecting pucks
	- static/actuated
	- look for cans with a sweeper
	- have a collector under the robot, counting how many pucks already collected
* holding on to pucks
* avoid walls
	- use IR sensors instead of whiskers?
* find and navigate to beacon
	- two sensors mounted statically in two directions in order to find heading


* we need:
sharp, whiskers, puck-sensors, servos, beacon-sensors, kappa-board/cardboard.
